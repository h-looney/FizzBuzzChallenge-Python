FizzBuzz Application in Python
Introduction
The FizzBuzz problem is a common programming exercise that tests a programmer's ability to use conditional statements and loops to solve a simple problem. The problem consists of printing out a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". In this document, we will describe the implementation of a FizzBuzz application in Python.

Requirements
The requirements for the FizzBuzz application are as follows:

The application should take an integer n as input from the user.
The application should print out a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
Design
The FizzBuzz application will be implemented in Python using a for loop to iterate over the sequence of numbers from 1 to n. For each number in the sequence, we will use conditional statements to determine if it is a multiple of 3, 5, or both, and print out the appropriate string.

Implementation
The implementation of the FizzBuzz application in Python is as follows:

python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
In this implementation, we first prompt the user to enter a number using the input() function and convert it to an integer using the int() function. We then use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to n+1. For each number in the sequence, we use conditional statements to determine if it is a multiple of 3, 5, or both, and print out the appropriate string. If the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, we simply print out the number itself.

Conclusion
In this document, we have described the implementation of a FizzBuzz application in Python. By using conditional statements and loops, we were able to solve the problem of printing out a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". This simple exercise demonstrates the power of programming and the ability to solve complex problems using code.
